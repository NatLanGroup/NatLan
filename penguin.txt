Penguins eat seafood. 
They hunt squid, shellfish, and other fish. 
Being good swimmers helps them hunt and have food to eat.
When they are young, the thicker outer layer of feathers has not grown in yet.
This means their parents have to provide food for them.
They do this by regurgitating their food.
The parent hunts and catches food. 
They then throw it back up into the chickâ€™s beak.

There are 18 different kinds of penguins. 
They are different in size and color. 
They live all over the southern half of the world. 
This is called the southern hemisphere.
The tallest of them is the emperor penguin in Antarctica. 
Female emperor penguins lay one egg at a time. 
After the female penguin lays the egg, she passes it over to the male penguin to hatch. 
She must pass the egg very carefully. 
Itâ€™s important not to let the egg be in the cold for too long or it will freeze.
Are there various kinds of penguins?
How do they differ?
Where do penguins live?
How is the emperor penguin special?
Where is the egg of the emperor penguin?

Penguins lay eggs like other birds, but not all penguins make a nest. 
Instead, the male emperor penguin carries it between his feet.
He protects it from the cold with a flap of belly skin.

Penguins in warmer climates cool off in many ways. 
Their feathers can be used to keep them cool as well as warm. 
By puffing their feathers up, it allows cooler air to reach their skin. 
They also pant. 
Panting causes the throat and mouth to cool down. 
Holding out their flippers to the air also releases heat.
