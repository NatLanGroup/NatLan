
e/ Coral reefs are a habitat for many animals.
e/ Coral reefs are in warm oceans all over the world.
e/ Coral reefs are habitats occupied by many kinds of animals.
e/ Coral is a kind of small animal.
e/ They live in coral reefs and they produce the hard body of it.
e/ They have soft bodies but they make a hard shell in which they live.
e/ Corals eat small plant-like and animal-like living things that float in the water.
e/ Besides corals, there are many inhabitants of coral reefs.
e/ They include soft corals, the nautilus, the lionfish, the striped angelfish, the red reef crabs, the blue-spotted ray, the spotted butterflyfish, scallops, and sea anemones.

e/ Soft corals are corals that do not make a hard shell.
e/ If you look at them carefully, you can see white hard parts.
e/ When the animal dies these become part of the sand near the reef.

e/ The nautilus is a relative of an octopus.
e/ It is striped on the top part of the shell, and light colored on the bottom.
e/ This way it blends in with its surroundings.

e/ The lionfish is one of the most beautiful fish in the ocean.
e/ However, it is dangerous.
e/ Its spines have a poison that can be deadly to people.

e/ Red reef crabs dig burrows in the sand near coral reefs.
e/ Many are scavengers, which means that they eat the remains of dead things.

e/ The blue-spotted ray is a relative of sharks.
e/ It has a skeleton that is not made of bone but of a softer, more flexible material called cartilage.

e/ The spotted butterflyfish has a long snout with which it searches holes in the reef for food. 
e/ Each spotted butterflyfish has its own territory, which it guards against all other fish.

e/ Scallops are soft-bodied animals with hard shells.
e/ They are related to clams.
e/ Sometimes you can see two rows of blue eyes along the opening of the shells.

e/ Sea anemones are related to corals.
e/ They have poison they can inject into animals to stun them.
e/ This helps them capture food.  

e/ Antelopes are a little bit like deer. 
e/ They eat plants. 
e/ Wildebeests are a kind of antelope. 
e/ They often are in the same places as zebras. 
e/ These animals all live in the savannah.
e/ Some cat-like animals called cheetahs also live in the savannah.
e/ They are a kind of big cat. 
e/ They eat other animals. 
e/ The animals they eat are often the weak or the sick animals. 
e/ A cheetah might eat an antelope or a zebra.
e/ Do antelopes, zebras and cheetahs form an animal community?

e/ Elephants are very large animals in the savannah. 
e/ Elephants eat plants. 
e/ Elephants are so big that other animals don't try to eat them.
e/ Other animals in the savannah are giraffes. 
e/ Giraffes are a little like horses with very long necks. 
e/ Giraffes have black tongues. 
e/ They eat the leaves from the tops of the trees.

e/ Hyenas live in the savannah too. 
e/ They are a little bit like dogs. 
e/ They eat other animals. 
e/ Sometimes when a lion eats there is food left over. 
e/ Hyenas will eat this leftover food. 
e/ They are like garbage collectors. 
e/ They help keep their communities clean. 

e/ Lions are a kind of big cat. 
e/ Lions will eat zebras and antelopes. 
e/ Lions do not try to eat elephants or giraffes.

e/ Zebras are like horses with black and white stripes. 
e/ Zebras eat plants. 
e/ Zebras run away when they are scared.

e/ Wart hogs are like pigs. 
e/ Wart hogs will eat almost anything, like plants and small animals.
e/ They have long teeth called tusks. 
e/ They use their tusks to protect themselves.

e/ Plants are also part of the community of the savannah. 
e/ For some animals plants are like grocery stores. 
e/ Animals go to eat the plants. 
e/ Zebras, wart hogs, antelopes, giraffes, and elephants all eat plants.
 
e/ Ladybugs eat fruit flies and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.
e/ The environment of the animal is everything that surrounds and affects the animal, including living and nonliving things.
e/ It also includes things affected by the animal.
e/ An ecosystem is made up of groups of living things and the environment they live in.
// now is it possible to know that ecosystem=community of animals, plants, and the environment?
e/ The parts of an ecosystem - animals, plants and nonliving things - interact with each other.

e/ Deserts are the driest places on Earth. 
e/ A desert is an ecosystem where there is very little rainfall. 
// now we know that ecosystems also include a place! 
e/ Most deserts get less than 25 cm of rain each year. 
e/ Desert plants and animals need very little water to live.

e/ There are two kinds of deserts, hot and cold deserts. 
e/ Hot deserts can have temperatures over 43°C during the day. 
e/ Night temperatures drop to about 7°C. 
e/ Even winters are mild, with temperatures usually above freezing. 
e/ Cold deserts have freezing temperatures and blizzards in the winter. 
e/ But in the summer, they get as hot as hot deserts. 
e/ The Sonoran Desert is a hot desert located in parts of California, Arizona, and Mexico. 
e/ It is divided into several regions. 
e/ Its northeastern region is called the Arizona Upland.

e/ Many different types of plants and animals live in the Arizona Upland region of the Sonoran Desert.
e/ Low-lying trees, thorny shrubs (called scrub), and cacti are common here.
e/ The saguaro cactus grows only in the Sonoran Desert and is found everywhere in this region except on valley floors. 
e/ This area is known as the saguaro-paloverde forest because of the saguaro cacti and the paloverde trees. 
e/ Different flowers bloom at different times of the year. 
e/ Animals living in the Arizona Upland include javelinas, desert tortoises, kangaroo rats, snakes, birds, coyotes, and lizards. 

e/ Native Americans lived in the Arizona Upland region of the Sonoran Desert more than a thousand years ago. 
e/ Today, people still live throughout this area. 
e/ Tucson, Arizona, a large city, is found in the Arizona Upland region.

e/ The Arizona Upland region is both the highest and the coldest part of the Sonoran Desert. 
e/ Mountain ranges and valleys are found in this area.
e/ There are five seasons in this region: fall, winter, spring, the foresummer drought (from May through June), and the rainy season (from July to mid-September). 
e/ During the rainy season, there is about 13 cm (5 in.) of rain. 
e/ Though that is not much rain, it is more than a third of the rain that falls all year. 
e/ There is some rain and frost in the winter.

e/ Animals live.							
e/ If something lives, then it is an animal.		
e/ Animals are the same as living things.	
e/ Nonliving things do not live.
e/ Animals are not nonliving things.
e/ Nonliving things are not animals.
e/ A dead animal does not live.				
e/ An animal not living is dead.			
e/ An animal that lives is not dead.		
e/ An animal that is not dead lives.		
e/ Living animals move.						
e/ Moving animals live.						
e/ Animals move.							
e/ Dead animals do not move.				
e/ Things that are alive are the same as living things.  

e/ The world is made up of living things and nonliving things.
e/ Animals move by themselves.
e/ Animals eat.
e/ Animals grow.
e/ Animals have babies.
e/ All living things grow and change.
e/ They need food, water and air.
e/ Things that are not alive are nonliving.
e/ They do not need food, water and air.
e/ You can tell that something is alive if it can move by itself without being pushed or pulled.
e/ Living things eat food.
e/ Only living things can reproduce, which means produce offspring.
e/ Living things can use their senses of taste, smell, sight, and hearing to react to the world around them.

e/ Animals can move, eat and grow.
e/ Animals have babies.
e/ Things that are not alive cannot do any of these things.
e/ Dead animals cannot do any of these things.

e/ Things are alive when you see them move by themselves.
e/ They can move without being pushed or driven, and they do not need batteries or engines.

e/ A dog and a chick are living things.
e/ They come from other living things.
e/ Like all living things, they need food, air, and water.
e/ Like all living things, they grow and change.

e/ Air, water, and light are nonliving things.
e/ They do not grow.
e/ They do not need food.
e/ Living things need nonliving things.
e/ Animals need air, food, and water to live.

e/ What are three ways living things are alike?
e/ How do living things use nonliving things?

e/ Animals need to breathe.
e/ They breathe in oxygen.
e/ They must have it to live.
e/ There is lots of oxygen in the air.
e/ Animals living on land breathe air to get the oxygen they need.
e/ These animals use their lungs to breathe air.

e/ Many animals live in water.
e/ These are animals like fish and shells.
e/ They cannot breathe air because there is no air under the water.
e/ So these animals don`t have lungs.
e/ Water in streams and ponds and oceans has oxygen in it.
e/ Fish use gills to get oxigen.
e/ Only animals living in water have gills.

e/ When a fish uses its gill, it first opens its mouth.
e/ The water goes in. It has some oxygen in it.
e/ The water goes past the gills.
e/ Gills get the oxygen out of the water.
e/ The oxygen goes into the fish`s body.
e/ The water keeps going. It goes out of the gills, back into the pond.
e/ That is how the fish uses gills to breathe oxygen in the water.

e/ If an animal breathes, then it lives.
e/ Living animals breathe.
e/ Dead animals do not breathe.

e/ Why do animals need air?
e/ Do all animals need air?
e/ What do all animals need?

e/ Legs, head, mouth, eyes, ears, teeth, skin are body parts of animals.
e/ Animals have a body.
e/ The body of animals is a tangible object.
e/ Many animals have legs.							
e/ Snakes are animals.								
e/ Snakes and worms don`t have legs.				
e/ Birds are animals.							
e/ Birds have wings.							
e/ Other animals mostly don`t have wings.		
e/ Animals have a head.								
e/ Animals have eyes on their head.
e/ Animals have mouth on their head.
e/ Many animals have teeth in their mouth.
e/ A jaw is a mouth with many teeth.
e/ Many animals have a tail.						

e/ Animals have skin.						
e/ The skin covers the animal all around.		
e/ The skin protects the animal.					
e/ The skin is often covered by fur.			
e/ The skin of birds is covered by feathers.		
e/ Thus the skin of birds is not covered by fur.	

e/ Different animals have different types of skin.
e/ The skin is the same as body covering.
e/ Some animals have hair or fur.
e/ Some animals have feathers.
e/ Some have scales and spines.
e/ Some have a hard shell.
e/ Crabs, tortoise, and snails have a hard shell.
e/ Birds have feathers.
e/ Dogs, elephants have hair.

e/ Some animals use special body parts to fly, swim, or walk.
e/ Animals use legs to move.					
e/ Some animals don`t have legs.
e/ They use their body to crawl.
e/ Birds use their wings to fly.
e/ To crawl or to fly is to move.
e/ Fish use fins to swim.
e/ To swim is to move.
 
e/ Animals use eyes to see.
e/ Animals use ears to hear.

e/ Animals use mouth to eat.
e/ Animals use teeth to eat and bite.

e/ Fur protects animals from heat and cold.
e/ Feathers protect animals from heat and cold.

e/ Gills help fish to breathe in the water.

e/ Some animals are big, like horses, elephants, giraffes, camels, cows, bears and lions.
e/ These are all bigger than a man.
e/ Antelopes and deer are big as well.
e/ Elephants are the biggest ones.

e/ Dogs, cats, foxes, birds, snakes are not very big.
e/ They are not small, either.
e/ They are smaller than a man, but bigger  than a pencil.

e/ Worms and bugs are small animals, smaller than a pencil.
e/ If an animal is big, its size is big.
e/ If an animal is small, its size is small.
e/ All animals have a size.
e/ Nonliving things often have a size, too.
e/ The size of something is usually either big, or small.

e/ Some animals eat other animals.
e/ These eat animals which are smaller or weaker than themselves.
e/ Small and weak animals are afraid of large animals who may eat them.
e/ They try to avoid being eaten.

e/ If you look closely at an animal, you can count how many legs it has.
e/ This helps to tell you what sort of animal it is.
e/ Spiders have eight legs.
e/ Insects have six legs.
e/ Mammals, reptiles and amphibians have four legs.
e/ Birds have two legs.

e/ You can recognize different animal groups by the features they have in common.
e/ For example, mammals have hair on their skin, birds have feathers, reptiles have scales, amphibians have slimy skin, and fish have scales and fins.

e/ A pigeon is a bird.
e/ It has feathers.
e/ A lizard is a reptile.
e/ It has scales.
e/ A cat is a mammal.
e/ It has hair.
e/ A frog is an amphibian.
e/ It has slimy skin.
e/ A goldfish is a fish.
e/ It has scales and fins.

e/ Cats, dogs, horses, birds, wolfs, foxes, snakes, worms, bugs are types of animals.
e/ Two animals of the same type look similar.
e/ Two animals of the same type have similar body parts.
e/ Two animals of the same type behave similarly.
e/ Cats, dogs, horses, wolfs, foxes, elephants, giraffes, camels, cows and zebras have four legs.
e/ They have a head and a tail.
e/ They have fur covering their body.
e/ Some of them eat plants, like horses, elephants, giraffes, camels, zebras and cows.

e/ Dogs, cats, wolves, foxes, lions eat meat.
e/ This means they hunt other animals, for example zebras.
e/ They are predators.
e/ The animals hunted by predators are the prey of the predators.
e/ When predators catch the prey, they kill it and eat it.
e/ Monkeys are animals being somewhat similar to people.
e/ They have two hands and two legs.
e/ They are very good at climbing trees.
e/ Birds have two legs and two wings.
e/ Unlike most animals, birds can fly.
e/ Snakes have no legs but they have a head and a tail.
e/ Worms have no legs and no head.
e/ Most bugs have six legs and a head. 
e/ Many bugs have wings and can fly.

e/ Two foxes or two snakes are similar to each other.
e/ They have similar form, size and colour.
e/ They eat similar food and do similar things.
e/ This is true for all other kinds of animals.

e/ Animals can be grouped by their body parts.
e/ All the animals on these two pages have bones inside their bodies.
e/ They have other body parts that make them different.
e/ Cats and dogs are mammals.
e/ A mammal is an animal that has fur or hair.
e/ A mother mammal makes milk and feeds it to its young.
e/ Birds are animals.
e/ Birds have feathers to protect their bodies.
e/ They also have wings.
e/ Most birds use their wings to fly.
e/ Lizards, snakes and turtles are reptiles.
e/ A reptile is an animal that is covered with scales.
e/ Its skin is rough and dry.
e/ Frogs and toads are amphibians. 
e/ An amphibian often has smooth, wet skin.
e/ Its skin helps it live both in water and on land.
e/ All fish live in water.
e/ A fish uses its fins to swim and its gills to breathe.

e/ Frogs are amphibians.
e/ This means frogs seem to live two lives.
e/ Young frogs live and grow in water.
e/ As full grown frogs, they live on land and in water.

e/ Frogs start life inside an egg in the water.
e/ A single frog lays a lot of eggs.
e/ After some time young frogs hatch from their eggs.
e/ This means they leave the egg.
e/ Can you see the young frog before it has left the egg?
e/ These young frogs are called tadpoles.
e/ Tadpoles live in the water and breathe with gills.
e/ Tadpoles have no legs.
e/ They swim with a tail.
e/ Very young tadpoles feed on the egg yolk they still have in their gut.

e/ Soon tadpoles grow back legs, and after that, front legs.
e/ But they still keep their tail.
e/ They may begin to eat foods like insects and plants.

e/ Then tadpoles become froglets.
e/ A froglet looks like a small adult frog.
e/ It has four legs and it breathes with lungs.
e/ But it still has a stubby tail.
e/ Soon it will leave the water and live on dry land.

e/ A full grown frog no longer looks like a tadpole.
e/ It has legs and lungs.
e/ Its gills and tail are gone.
e/ Full grown frogs start the life cycle again when females lay more eggs.

e/ If something is good for an animal, then the animal`s goal is to achieve it.    
e/ If something is bad for an animal, then the animal`s goal is to avoid it.  	
e/ To avoid something means it is not the actor`s goal.
e/ The animal is better off means something is good for the animal.
e/ The needs of an animal are the goals of the animal.
e/ To meet needs is the same as to achieve goals.
e/ To live is good for the animal.			
e/ To sleep is good for the animal.			
e/ The animal has goals that are good for the animal.
e/ To die is bad for the animal.
e/ Therefore animals want to survive.
e/ If an animal dies, it does not survive.
e/ Survive means the animal does not die.
e/ If the animal does not die then it lives.
e/ A threat to the animal is something that is bad for the animal.
e/ A threat for the animal may cause the animal to die.

e/ If an animal can do something and wants to do that, then the animal does it.
e/ If an animal has a goal, it wants that goal.
e/ If the animal`s goal is to avoid something, then the animal does not want that something.
e/ If the animal cannot do something, then it doesn`t do it.
e/ If the animal does not want to do something, then it usually does not do it.
e/ In case it does, then it does it unintentionally.

e/ Animal action means the animal does something.
e/ Animal actions are usually intentional.
e/ An animal action is intentional means the animal does the action intentionally.
e/ Move, eat, see, hear, smell, touch, hunt, search, flee, communicate, stand, sit, lay, hide, live, do, try, use, achieve, avoid, mate, raise, feed are all intentional actions of animals.
e/ To have a goal is an intentional action of the animal.

e/ By doing an intentional action, the animal usually has a goal.
e/ The goal the animal has is called the goal of the action.
e/ If an action has a goal, then the action is intentional.

e/ Some actions of animals are unintentional.
e/ These are actions that may be done by nonliving things as well.
e/ Actions specific to animals are usually intentional.
e/ The birth of an animal is an unintentional action.
e/ If an animal dies, that is unintentional.
e/ Grow, fall, become are unintentional actions.
e/ The actions freeze, fear, bleed, collapse are unintentional.
e/ Unintentional actions are often bad for the animal.
e/ Unintentional actions are rarely good for the animal.
e/ Actions an animal wants to avoid are usually unintentional.
e/ A dead animal can only do unintentional actions.

e/ If an animal does an intentional action, then the animal wants that action.
e/ If the animal does not want something but does it, then it is an unintentional action of the animal.
e/ If an animal wants something and does it, then it is an intentional action of the animal.

e/ Animals eat food.
e/ Feeding helps animals to grow and stay healthy.
e/ All animals need to eat food and drink water to stay alive.
e/ If animals do not eat or drink, they die.
e/ Some animals eat plants and some eat other animals.
e/ Some animals eat both plants and other animals.
e/ Animals of the same kind eat the same thing.

e/ Owls eat mice.
e/ Rabbits eat plants.
e/ Caterpillars eat plants.
e/ Foxes eat mice and chicken.
e/ Chickens eat corn and worms.
e/ When something eats, it must be alive.
e/ Only animals need to eat food, so they can grow and stay healthy.

e/ Being hungry is bad for the animal.  			
e/ Animals are often hungry.					
e/ Animals are sometimes not hungry.			
e/ If an animal eats, it is not hungry. 		
e/ If an animal is hungry, it wants to eat.  		
e/ If an animal is not hungry, it doesn`t want to eat.  
e/ If an animal has food, it can eat.			
e/ If an animal has no food, it cannot eat.  		
e/ If an animal finds food, it has food.  			
e/ If an animal doesn`t find food, it has no food.  
e/ If an animal doesn`t hunt, it has no food.		
e/ If an animal eats, it eats food.				
e/ Some animals eat other animals.
e/ These animals usually hunt to get food.
e/ Other animals eat plants.
e/ These animals don`t hunt.
e/ They search for food.
e/ A few animals may eat both other animals or plants.

e/ If the animal is hungry, it wants to eat.
e/ If the animal wants to eat, then it may hunt, or it may search for food.
e/ If the animal wants to hunt, it usually hunts.	 				
e/ If the animal wants to search food, it usually searches food.  	
e/ If the animal hunts, it usually has food.						
e/ If the animal searches food, it usually finds food.				
e/ If the animal finds food, it has food.
e/ If the animal has food, it can eat.
e/ If the animal eats, it is not hungry for a while.

e/ If an animal hunts, it hunts prey.
e/ If the animal wants to hunt, it starts searching for prey.
e/ Prey is another animal that the animal wants to catch in order to eat it.
e/ If the animal searches for prey, it may move in a large territory where the prey lives.
e/ After some time, the animal may notice the prey.
e/ If the animal does not notice any prey for a long time, then hunting was not successful.
e/ If the animal notices some prey, it tries to catch it.
e/ In order to catch it, the animal follows the prey.
e/ Or the animal hides, and suddenly jumps on the prey.
e/ Or the animal runs very fast and chases the prey. 
e/ The goal of following, jumping on or chasing the prey is to get close to it.
e/ Finally, if the animal is close enough, it catches the prey.
e/ To catch the prey is a contact action.
e/ If the animal catches the prey, then it usually kills it.
e/ Before the animal catches the prey, the prey tries to get away.
e/ If the prey is faster than the animal, then it flees.
e/ If the prey flees, then it gets too far from the animal.
e/ Contact action is not possible anymore.
e/ So the animal does not catch the prey.
e/ If the animal does not catch any prey, then the hunting is unsuccessful.

e/ If the animal catches the prey, then the prey may fight to get free.
e/ If the prey gets free, it flees, and the hunting was not successful.
e/ If the hunting is not successful, the animal has no food.
e/ If the prey does not get free, the animal kills it.
e/ In this case the hunting was successful.
e/ The prey is the food for the animal.
e/ Now the animal has food.
 
e/ An action by an animal or object may be exclusive.
e/ This means that the action takes a time interval and no other action can be performed in that interval.
e/ If an action is not exclusive, then another action may be done in the same time interval.

e/ An object impacted by an action may be exclusive.
e/ This means that during the time interval of the action no other object can be impacted.
e/ If an object is not exclusive, then another object can be impacted in the same time interval.
e/ Most animal actions and their impacted objects are exclusive.

e/ If the animal makes an action, and it impacts something, then this may be a contact action.
e/ A contact action means that the animal and the impacted something are close to each other.
e/ They are so close that the animal can touch the impacted something.
e/ If they are not close enough, the contact action is not possible.

e/ Some actions are not contact actions. 
e/ These are called distant actions. 
e/ For a distant action, the animal and the impacted something does not need to be close to each other.

e/ If the animal is doing an action, it is not doing another action at the same time.
e/ The animal can do the next action after the current action is finished.
e/ If the animal can do actions X and Y and wants to do X and Y, then it needs to select which action to do.
e/ The animal selects the most important action.
e/ The most important action is good for the animal.
e/ The most important action is better for the animal than the least important action.

e/ If an animal doesn`t eat for a long while, it will die.

e/ Animals may walk, run, jump, flee, crawl, climb, swim or fly.
e/ All these mean that the animal moves and changes location.
e/ All these are intentional actions.
e/ Animals can also move like nonliving things, and these actions are unintentional.
e/ If an animal makes a movement, that means the animal moves.
e/ Some movements do not change the animal`s location.
e/ These are turn, stretch, bend.
e/ These change the form of the animal.
e/ If an animal stops, sits, lays, stays or hides, it means the animal does not move.

e/ Things that are not alive move in different ways.
e/ Some things fall, some roll, some fly, some slide, some bounce, and some things pour.
e/ These are not intentional actions.
e/ Only animals can do intentional actions.

e/ Mallard ducks live in ponds.
e/ For food, they like insects, snails, and seeds.
e/ The brown male can change color.
e/ When he courts the female, his head turns green, and his chest feathers become purple.
e/ What kind of duck is the story about?
e/ Where do these ducks live?
e/ What part of the plant do they eat?
e/ What color is the male most of the time?
e/ What happens to his feathers when he courts the female?
e/ What turns green?

e/ For almost 5000 years, cats have been kept as pets.
e/ Cats have a great sense of smell, but they can`t see as well as people.
e/ Whiskers help them feel their way in the dark.
e/ Kittens` eyes open within two weeks of their birth.
e/ How long have cats been kept as pets?

e/ The African Rock Python lives in the savanna.
e/ It grows to 26 feet long.
e/ It is a constrictor snake.
e/ The snake kills its prey by wrapping itself around it until it can`t breathe.
e/ The snake does not use its small teeth.
e/ It swallows its prey whole.
e/ It can open its mouth so wide it can swallow an antelope.
e/ Where does the African Rock Python live?
e/ What kind of snake is it?
e/ How long is it?
e/ How does it kill its prey?
e/ Does it use its teeth to eat?
e/ How does it swallow its food?
e/ What large animal can it swallow?

e/ The killer whale is also known as the orca.
e/ It is black and white.
e/ It is found mostly near polar ice regions.
e/ The males are 30 feet long.
e/ The females are 15 feet in length.
e/ They are the most feared whales in the sea because they are deadly hunters.
e/ They eat dolphins, penguins, fish, and squid.
e/ They have large teeth and a fin on their backs, which is called a dorsal fin.
