This keeps a warm layer of air near the skin.  s4   IM(s4, s1)  A(this,I(F(keep,R(near,skin)),P(air,F(layer,warm))))
X keep F(Y,a,R()) -> A(exist, F(Y,a,R())) 
EXISTENCE STATEMENTS 
A(is, F(x,y)) == F(x,y) and x, was known, needs mapped			The fox in the garden is red.
A(exist, F(x,y)) == F(x,y) and x, x was not known, no mapping   There is a red fox in the garden.
A(emerge, F(x,y)) == F(x,y) and now x, previously no x.         Red foxes move from the north to the garden.
