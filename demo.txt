			p=4 means it is not surpirising at all. 
			p=0 means it is not true, it would be very very surprising.
			g=1 means this applies to birds in general (not to a specific bird)
			exception=0 would mean this applies to each and every bird without exception
			exception=1 would mean this applies to every bird, with rare exceptions
			exception=4 would mean this applies to some birds in a well-known way but it does not apply for many other birds.
